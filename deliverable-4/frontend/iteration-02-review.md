 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.

 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

* When: Feb 9, Feb 23rd, next meeting is scheduled later this week with the our partner organization, and weekly meeting on staurday and the day before both deliverable 1 and 2 with group members. 

 * Where:  Online through discord

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.
* 2 - 4 decisions.
* Ordered from most to least important.
* Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
* Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

* Decision 1: We have our group meeting on discord's voice channel, where we have different text channels including general, back-end, front-end and to-do. After each meeting, the todo text channel would be updated, sumerizing what we went through in the meeting. This is extremely successul, considering we have group members all over the wolrd due to the pandemic, so whoever misses the meeting can always go back and check what happened and check whom is responsible for what. Moreover, the to-do list also include helpful link to help group members to understand the tools used in the project. This has been the a very effective way to communicate. 

* Decision2:  Weekly group meetings has been short and effective, and members are all well peroared so that we all know what to share, what to ask before the meeting. This has been another decision that improve our efficiency significantly. 


#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 
 
 * Decision1: Athough we have a weekly group meeting on Zoom at 11 a.m. every Saturday, yet the meeting time has became quite flexible and instantaneoous(shecheduling metting time 12 hrs in advance) since we all have different schedules as assignments and term tests approach, and it is challenging to find a fix time to meet. 
 
 *Decision2: We assign 3 members on backend, and 3 members on the front end at the very first meeting, yet, when it comes to deliverable 2 where the most of the work is frontend job, the role assignments became a bit messy. 


#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.
 
 * Due to our changeful scheudle, instead of meeting at 11am every staturday, members are asked when they care avaiable for the weekly meeting at the begining of that week, so that we can all find a good time to meet during that week. In this way, we can know the meeting time and make time for it at least 48 hours in advance. 
 
 * Instead of assigning people immediately without reading what is required and expected in each deliverable, we decided to first go through any new task before assigning people, in this way, we can better ensure that everyone can controbute evenly in the project.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?


 * How did you prepare your demo?
    * We implemented the frontend part as deliverable 1 suggested in our application to prepare for the demo, so that our client can get an idea of the workflow of the app. 
 
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
    *We delivered an APK(Android Package Kit) app to our partner. 
 
 
 * Did your partner accept the features?
    * Our partner has accepted the features, as most of the stuff was covered in dliverable1. 
 
 
 * Were there change requests?
    * The partner prefer to have the application reachable in different devices and platform, incuding ios devices, android devices and web, hence, while implementing the application, we should no longer focus on just using java to develop an android app, instead, we decided to use reactnative to implement achive the goal. 
 

 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
    * We notice that instead of talking for a long time to describe a product, sometimes it is fatser to show the half finished product with hardcoded data to our clients, hence preparation and planings before the demo is crucialï¼Œ we would not only have the chance to hear direct feedback from him, but can also study how our client is interacting with the product.
